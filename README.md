# hugotest

We created this site with very helpful documentation from [blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) by Yihui Xie and Amber Thomas and [Up and running with blogdown](https://alison.rbind.io/post/up-and-running-with-blogdown/) by Alison Hill. 

Notes:

- To change the theme: 

```

blogdown::install_theme("digitalcraftsman/hugo-agency-theme", theme_example = TRUE, update_config = TRUE)

```
